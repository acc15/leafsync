# Index file format

Index files contains 2 sections as follows:

* Used mirrors table
* Entry tree

## Used mirrors table

Table contains list of paths to which tree was synchronized.

Names are null-terminated string

Empty names are prohibited - so empty name just designates end of mirrors table

### Example

	/mnt/sync\0
	/home/other\0
	\0 - mirrors table ended

## File tree with sync states

### Entry

	(name) '\0' <sync flags> [mirror flags]* [children entries]* '\0'

#### Sync flags

Flags contains next bit groups:

     87654   32   1
	[00000] [00] [0] 

* 1 bit - directory flag (0 - file, 1 - dir)
* 2-3 bits - enables sync of entry (`00` - not syncing, `01` - shallow dir/file sync, `10` (decimal - 2) - deep/recursive dir sync)
* other bits - unused

#### Mirror flags

Byte count of mirror flags is determined by used mirrors table and must be always equal to 

	(count of mirrors + 7) / 8

Each bit designates whether current entry was synchronized to mirror at specific index (in used mirror table) or not.

This information is required to determine how to resolve case when 
`left` contains file `"a"`, but `right` doesn't - as there is 2 solutions possible:

* add file `"a"` to `right`
* delete file `"a"` from `left`

### Example

	\b00000001\b00000000 <-- root flags and sync state
	 a\0\b00000001\b00000000 <-- Directory "a"
	  b.json\0\b00000010\b00000001\0 <-- Syncable file "b.json" - which already synced to first used mirror (`/mnt/sync`)
	 \0 <-- Designated end of "a" listing
	\0 <-- Designates end of root listing, all trailing '\0' also can be replaced with <EOF>
